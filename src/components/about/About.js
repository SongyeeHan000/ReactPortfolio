                Before attending Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy, I was a competitive performer and flute instructor for a decade. 
                I was a student at Rutgers University for my bachelor degree and Queens College for my master degree. I became interested in software engineering when I first saw a gadget called, "SoundBrenner", that aided musicians to keep a steady pulse through vibration pulses on their wrist or chest and helped musicians feel the beat internally. It improved many musiciansâ€™ musically like myself and it inspired me to think what other applications I could make to help other musicians or others if I were to become a software engineer. 
                When the pandemic started, I began my journey to become a software engineer by attending a coding bootcamp at Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy.
                I hope to collaborate with any of you to create a difference in other people's lives.
                <br></br>

                Outside of coding, you might catch me at a restaurant or cafe with friends, jazz club/bar, NYC or LA philharmonic concert, or a climbing gym. I also enjoy drawing my friends and events of my life.
